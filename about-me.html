            <h2>How I got to where I am now</h2>
            <p>
                I started my adult working life as a skilled tradesman. I went to
            Matrix Trade Institue to become an Automotive Technician. I aquired my
            entry level ASE's, G1 certification, HVAC certification and the United States EPA
            609 certification for working with automotive Freon's and such equipment.
            <br><br>
                After graduating from Matrix, I applied for chevy dealerships and had
            a few positions in that field that didn't go anywhere either through elderly
            owners being picky about working styles or young managers pushing down on his
            younger subbordinates to make himself look better to the owners. But that's 
            niether here nor there.
            <br><br>
                I eventually made a move to a larger yet similar field area, semi-trucks! 
            I began working at Mountain Tarp and Pioneer and one of the first things I learned 
            and really got solid with was welding. I really enjoyed this part of the job but 
            unfortunately, the company was still adjusting to a newer parent company aquisition 
            and there was a ton of friction between the older employees and upper managment which 
            just made the whole enviornment there almost unbearable. When the tension was reaching 
            it's peak, and mind you it was very common for the manager to come around and 
            check in on us frequently during the day, during one of those times it was 
            mentioned that it wouldnt be surprising if he and/or a few of us might be on the 
            chopping block due to their increasingly absurd demand for more and more production. 
            I reached out to a family friend, that night, who said I should look into coding 
            bootcamps and that maybe web development would be a great place to start since they 
            would be able to help if I needed it. My grand parents agreed it was time to make 
            the switch and I put in my two weeks.
            <br><br>
            And here I am now, enrolled in coding bootcamp with CareerFoundry! Learning how to be a 
            full stack web developer and designing this website as my first project, let me know how it
            turned out! This website will be revised and edited to show off my best knowledge as time 
            marches on.

            <h2>My Jack of All Trades Mentality</h2>
            <p>
                I've come to realise that life has many facets that require skills that
            are aquired through experience and practice. I have worked in many areas of life so far.
            Yet I still have barely scratched the surface of the job market. Wood working, machanics, 
            welding, these are all aquired skills that I pride myself in my proficiency, in their respective
            areas of knowledge and practiced skill. I may have only begun my career in coding, and I hope it
            is a long career indeed, and I hope and aspire to do great things in this line of work. I will 
            continue to learn and evolve as a person. Though I don't know yet what things I know will be
            beneficial to this career path, and it may be nothing I knew before will be of any help, and 
            in that moment I will realise I need to learn more, then come back and re-tackle what I didn't 
            understand before.
            </p>
